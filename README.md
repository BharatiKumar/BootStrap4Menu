# BootStrap4Menu
This is a html page using BootStrap 4. This has responsive header and some responsive body elements. 


This is developed using Visual Studio Code which is free to download.

Pre-requisites:
1. Visual studio code
2. Node.js


Firstly, install both visual studio code and node.js on your system. 
Create a new folder BootStrap4 in C or D drive and navigate to BootStrap4. Copy all the files from this GIT repository to BootStrap4 folder. 

Open command prompt and navigate to BootStrap4

Run the following:
npm init -y
npm i gulp browser-sync gulp-sass --save-dev
npm i bootstrap jquery popper.js --save 
npm install -g gulp
code .  (this command will open visual studio code editor if visual studio code editor is not already open)
gulp    ( "gulp" command  runs the gulpfile.js which actually opens the Index.html in a browser with a default port of 3000).

 
Any changes that we make in index.html will automatically be reflected in the browser through browser-sync.
